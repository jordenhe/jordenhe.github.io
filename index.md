-------------------------------------

let's write some markdown syntax

## some examples of syntax
Paragraphs are separated by a blank line.

Two spaces at the end of a line
produces a line break. 
 **bold**, *Italy*, ***both italy and bold***, 'monospace ' (Text attributes)

<s> this is strike through text </s>


 > block quote with vertical line at the beginning
 ends it with a blank line

 	indent 4 spaces to disable markdown
	<b> no *markdown*


Bullet list:
	* apples
	* oranges
	* pears

Numbered list:
	1. wash
	2. rinse
	3. repeat

To start an ordered list, write this:

1. this starts a list *with* numbers
+  this will show as number "2"
*  this will show as number "3."
9. any number, +, -, or * will keep the list going.
    * just indent by 4 spaces (or tab) to make a sub-list
		1. keep indenting for more sub lists
		
	* here i'm back to the second level
