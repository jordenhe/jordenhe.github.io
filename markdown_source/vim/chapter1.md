# Notes on chapter 1: Basic Editing
## Runing vim
* use touch ~/.vimrc to configure a vim editor
* we can use :set nocompatible to let vi have vim features
* The tilde (~) lines indicate lines not in the file.
* vim will use the window depending on the terminal windows (GNOME Terminal for ubuntu)
* The Vim editor is a modal editor.That means that the editor behaves differently, depending on which mode you are in (normal, insert, visual).
* If you are in trouble, to get back to normal mode, no matter what mode you are in, press the <Esc\> key.
* moving around:  h (left), j (down), k (up), and l (right)
* To exit, use the ZZ command.This command writes the file and exits.
* Help: use :help or :help command or :help key words to find help. And use CRTL-] to go to the hyperlink of tag
